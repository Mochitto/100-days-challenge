### Day 1: February 13, 2021 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Git/GitHub and Python

**Today's Progress**: I've learned how to use Git and GitHub thanks to [amigoscode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUbBnN_H2c)!  
I've also started the udemy course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

**Thoughts:** This is my very first repository and I'm very excited about all of the things I will learn! Git was a small bit confusing (especially how to rebase and using ssh keys) but being able to use it feels very rewarding.  
Today's project was very easy and fast to write, looking forward to the next ones!

### Day 2: February 14, 2021 - Monday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've created a Bill calculator app! No more fights with my friends >:)

**Thoughts:** The udemy course is proving to be rather interesting! The app is simple, but I feel like it was very useful to implement other tips on how to write cleaner code. I was also able to commit the files to the repository from git!

### Day 3: February 15, 2021 - Tuesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I now have my own Rock, Paper, Scissor app!

**Thoughts:** Today it was a bit hard to start watching the lessons... but as soon as I got to coding, I was able to focus a lot!

### Day 4: February 16, 2021 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Made a Password generator!

**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day, I had to cover this project on the next day; got it done! Now it's time to get on to the next one.

### Day 5: February 17, 2021 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've revised loops! There was no real project today, but many challenges on Reeborg's world.

**Thoughts:** Today the lesson was more on understanding the concept of loops, both while and for loops. Most of the code was pseudo-code, but was very useful to set things in my mind! I decided to link the last challenge of the day; creating an AI that can get out of a random maze.

### Day 6: February 18, 2021 - Friday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Made another game app, this time is Hangman!

**Thoughts:** I've found out the course will get a bit worse after the first third of it; it apparently is outdated and without stupport. I'll go and finish it anyway probably. If anything, I'll get a lot of practice.
