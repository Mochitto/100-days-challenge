### Day 1: February 13, 2021 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Git/GitHub and Python

**Today's Progress**: I've learned how to use Git and GitHub thanks to [amigoscode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUbBnN_H2c)!  
I've also started the udemy course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

**Thoughts:** This is my very first repository and I'm very excited about all of the things I will learn! Git was a small bit confusing (especially how to rebase and using ssh keys) but being able to use it feels very rewarding.  
Today's project was very easy and fast to write, looking forward to the next ones!

### Day 2: February 14, 2021 - Monday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've created a Bill calculator app! No more fights with my friends >:)

**Thoughts:** The udemy course is proving to be rather interesting! The app is simple, but I feel like it was very useful to implement other tips on how to write cleaner code. I was also able to commit the files to the repository from git!

### Day 3: February 15, 2021 - Tuesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I now have my own Rock, Paper, Scissor app!

**Thoughts:** Today it was a bit hard to start watching the lessons... but as soon as I got to coding, I was able to focus a lot!

### Day 4: February 16, 2021 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Made a Password generator!

**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day, I had to cover this project on the next day; got it done! Now it's time to get on to the next one.

### Day 5: February 17, 2021 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've revised loops! There was no real project today, but many challenges on Reeborg's world.

**Thoughts:** Today the lesson was more on understanding the concept of loops, both while and for loops. Most of the code was pseudo-code, but was very useful to set things in my mind! I decided to link the last challenge of the day; creating an AI that can get out of a random maze.

### Day 6: February 18, 2021 - Friday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Made another game app, this time is Hangman! Later on the day, I've also made the Caesar Cipher!

**Thoughts:** I've found out the course will get a bit worse after the first third of it; it apparently is outdated and without support. I'll go and finish it anyway probably. If anything, I'll get a lot of practice and I'm still quite excited about the portfolio projects!

### Day 7: February 19, 2021 - Saturday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've revised dictionaries! Got a Secret bidder app which kid of feels like eBay's!.

**Thoughts:**  I feel like I had developed some bad habits regarding dictionaries from Automate the boring stuff; I'm happy I'm fixing those!

### Day 8: February 20, 2021 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've made four, FOUR apps! Revised dictionaries, functions and debugging!

**Thoughts:**  Today I was on F-I-R-E! Out of this first week of the challenge, this was the day in which I got the most progress!

#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Today the focus was on OOP! 

**Thoughts:**  OOP is not an entirely new concept to me, but I didn't study it well, so I'm learning so much! The apps that I'm making are getting more and more complex!

### Day 11: February 23, 2021 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Got better at Turtle!

**Thoughts:**  Today's lessons were focused on creating games with Turtle, with the final objective of learning how inheritances and OOP work. I'm very happy with the results!

### Day 12: February 24, 2021 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Yet another project with turtle, today was Pong's turn!

**Thoughts:**  I feel like Turtle isn't the best way to go about making games... The game slows down due to the processes being memory-intense. I have yet to see the solution from the course teacher abou this project, but I honestly do not think I'll come back to fix this. 
I also struggled a lot with working today as I felt a lot the news about Ukraine and Russia... Hope tomorrow is a better day.
