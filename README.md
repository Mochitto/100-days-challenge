### Day 1: February 13, 2022 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Git/GitHub and Python

**Today's Progress**: I've learned how to use Git and GitHub thanks to [amigoscode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUbBnN_H2c)!  
I've also started the udemy course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

**Thoughts:** This is my very first repository and I'm very excited about all of the things I will learn! Git was a small bit confusing (especially how to rebase and using ssh keys) but being able to use it feels very rewarding.  
Today's project was very easy and fast to write, looking forward to the next ones!

----------------

### Day 2: February 14, 2022 - Monday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've created a Bill calculator app! No more fights with my friends >:)

**Thoughts:** The udemy course is proving to be rather interesting! The app is simple, but I feel like it was very useful to implement other tips on how to write cleaner code. I was also able to commit the files to the repository from git!

### Day 3: February 15, 2022 - Tuesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I now have my own Rock, Paper, Scissor app!

**Thoughts:** Today it was a bit hard to start watching the lessons... but as soon as I got to coding, I was able to focus a lot!

### Day 4: February 16, 2022 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Made a Password generator!

**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day, I had to cover this project on the next day; got it done! Now it's time to get on to the next one.

---------------

### Day 5: February 17, 2022 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've revised loops! There was no real project today, but many challenges on Reeborg's world.

**Thoughts:** Today the lesson was more on understanding the concept of loops, both while and for loops. Most of the code was pseudo-code, but was very useful to set things in my mind! I decided to link the last challenge of the day; creating an AI that can get out of a random maze.

----------------


### Day 6: February 18, 2022 - Friday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Made another game app, this time is Hangman! Later on the day, I've also made the Caesar Cipher!

**Thoughts:** I've found out the course will get a bit worse after the first third of it; it apparently is outdated and without support. I'll go and finish it anyway probably. If anything, I'll get a lot of practice and I'm still quite excited about the portfolio projects!

### Day 7: February 19, 2022 - Saturday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've revised dictionaries! Got a Secret bidder app which kid of feels like eBay's!.

**Thoughts:**  I feel like I had developed some bad habits regarding dictionaries from Automate the boring stuff; I'm happy I'm fixing those!

#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've made four, FOUR apps! Revised dictionaries, functions and debugging!

### Day 9: February 21, 2022 - Monday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Today the focus was on OOP! 

**Thoughts:**  OOP is not an entirely new concept to me, but I didn't study it well, so I'm learning so much! The apps that I'm making are getting more and more complex!

### Day 11: February 23, 2022 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Got better at Turtle!

**Thoughts:**  Today's lessons were focused on creating games with Turtle, with the final objective of learning how inheritances and OOP work. I'm very happy with the results!

### Day 12: February 24, 2022 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Yet another project with turtle, today was Pong's turn!

**Thoughts:**  I feel like Turtle isn't the best way to go about making games... The game slows down due to the processes being memory-intense. I have yet to see the solution from the course teacher abou this project, but I honestly do not think I'll come back to fix this. 
I also struggled a lot with working today as I felt a lot the news about Ukraine and Russia... Hope tomorrow will be a better day.

### Day 13.1: February 25, 2022 - Friday
#####

**Thoughts:**  I couldn't get myself to study today; my whole attention was for the news... War rages on... Hope tomorrow will be a better day.


---------------


### Day 13.2: February 26, 2022 - Saturday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Learned about directories! Added an highscore to the snake game after learning how to read/write files!

**Thoughts:** I still need to get back in it, but I'm making progress!

**Link to work:** [Snake](https://github.com/Mochitto/100-days-challenge/tree/main/17.%20Snake)

### Day 14: February 27, 2022 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Learned about list/dictionary comprehension and the very basics of panda!

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm getting back in it :)

### Day 15: February 28, 2022 - Monday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've started learning about Tkinter! Made a pomodoro app and a Miles to Kms converter!

**Thoughts:** I think I will try and make a good pomodoro app! In the past, I looked a lot for a good one but it was never satisfying; fine, I'll do it myself!

**Link to works:**

--------------

### Day 16: March 1, 2022 - Tuesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: More TKinter!

**Thoughts:**  Today I tried a bit more to make the app look good, and I'm fairly satisfied by the result! GUI making takes so long tho...

--------------

### Day 17: March 2, 2022 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Learned what JSON files are and how to read them in python!

**Thoughts:**  I've updated the password manager by adding a search option and a json database (instead of a txt). Still not quite useful without encrypting the files, but it's a good start!

### Day 18: March 3, 2022 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Today I've started playing with APIs! 

**Thoughts:**  I've made four projects but I found them easy or uninspiring, so much I don't think it's worth spending the time it would take to clean up the code to upload it on github... 
One was a program that send automatic mails to friends (while needing permissions for less secure apps), another was a project that would tell you when the ISS was above you, after sunset (using two APIs), then an app that tells you random kanye quotes (API) and a last one that is a Quizz game (API) with an UI.


--------------

### Day 19: March 4, 2022 - Friday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Today I've started playing with APIs! 

**Thoughts:**  I always thought they would be much more complex, but they are pretty understandable! The weather forecast program was supposed to be used with Twilio API, but I do not feel comfortable using it, as money is involved in its transactions. I've also cleaned up the code of the IIS program from yesterday.

**Link to works:** 
1. [IIS space station overhead](https://github.com/Mochitto/100-days-challenge/blob/main/24.%20IIS%20space%20station%20and%20sunrise%20API.py)
2. [Weather forecast](https://github.com/Mochitto/100-days-challenge/blob/main/25.%20weather%20forecast%20API.py)

---------------

### Day 20: March 5, 2022 - Saturday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: More APIs, more requests, more coffee!!

**Thoughts:** These days' lessons are more on the technical side and I don't feel like the apps that are being suggested on the course are very interesting... I've decided to try and develop a Pomorodo studying app, so I'll be picking up another course on how to use Qt with python soon! 
I hope the development will start soon :)

### Days 20-30

### Day 21: March 6, 2022 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to learn how to use PyQt to make better UIs!

**Thoughts:** I've bought a new course and decided to put the other one in stand-by for a while, as I feel like it's important to create better UIs for the upcoming projects. Tkinter looks convenient for fast UIs, but I sadly can't think such UIs could be used for real projects that could be shared with non-tech-savvy people, that also look for an eye-candy app, not just functionalities.

---------------

### Day 22: March 7, 2022 - Monday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Learned to make issues on github!

**Thoughts:** Today I've spend most of the time doing typing practice and writing code in an issue! I'll go back to Qt tomorrow morning!

---------------

### Day 23: March 8, 2022 - Tuesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Focused on Qt with PyQt.

---------------

### Day 24: March 9, 2022 - Wednesday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Thoughts:** I got close to having a burnout today; the Qt course turned out to be kind of bad, spent most of the day to look for alternatives. The documentation alone from PyQt and Pyside is not enough and feels messy. PysimpleGui feels like glorified Tk... I feel like the best thing nowadays is looking towards the web and web-like GUIs (in electron?). I'll start studing some js on and focus on deepening my python knowledge on the side.

---------------

### Day 25: March 10, 2022 - Thursday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Thoughts:** I've lost my log streak, it's kind of sad to see the hole in the heat-map because I'm logging after midnight :(
After deciding to pick up html, css and js for electron, I've found out about 100Devs and I will be following their course!
I will keep on working mostly in python and do it on the side; since the new part of the Angela Yu course is about web scraping and the like, I will wait a while to get the hang of HTML and CSS before venturing into it, by following the course "Python 3: Deep dive".

---------------

### Day 26: March 11, 2022 - Friday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Huge break-through with Qt!

**Thoughts:** Altough I had thought I wouldn't be able to make UIs in Qt due to the lack of materials, I finally found a wonderful youtube account that has made over 150 videos on Qt for python! Today alone, I've gone through 15 of them and already feel like I'm getting a good grasp of how things work :)
I still want to learn some HTML and CSS, but I feel like this discovery will make my progresses slower in those ahah

---------------

### Day 27: March 12, 2022 - Saturday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Python

**Today's Progress**: Working hard on the pomodoro app!

**Thoughts:** I managed to make an heatmap work, tomorrow I'll add the interactivity and the animations!
