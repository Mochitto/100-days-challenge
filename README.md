### Day 1: February 13, 2021 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Git/GitHub and Python

**Today's Progress**: I've learned how to use Git and GitHub thanks to [amigoscode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUbBnN_H2c)!  
I've also started the udemy course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

**Thoughts:** This is my very first repository and I'm very excited about all of the things I will learn! Git was a small bit confusing (especially how to rebase and using ssh keys) but being able to use it feels very rewarding.  
Today's project was very easy and fast to write, looking forward to the next ones!
