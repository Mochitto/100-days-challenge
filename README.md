### Day 1: February 13, 2021 - Sunday
#####
**Today's Topics:** Git/GitHub

**Today's Progress**: I've learned how to use Git and GitHub thanks to [amigoscode's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fUbBnN_H2c)! 

**Thoughts:** This is my very first repository and I'm very excited about all of the things I will learn! Git was a small bit confusing (especially how to rebase and using ssh keys) but being able to use it feels very rewarding.

**Link to work:** Working on it!
